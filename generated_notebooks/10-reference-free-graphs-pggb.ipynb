    "pggb computes all pairwise alignments efficiently by focusing on long, colinear homologies, instead of using the more traditional k-mer matching alignment approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critically, pggb performs graph *normalization* to ensure that paths through the graph (e.g. chromosomes) have a linear structure while allowing for cyclic graph structures that capture structural variation.\n",

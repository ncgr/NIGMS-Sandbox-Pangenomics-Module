This means that some reads, containing this novel variation, might not align to the reference. In addition, there might be some bias when aligning reads and calling variants, with reads from individuals that are close to reference aligning better than those from more divergent individuals. This read alignment bias trickles down to the variant calling phase, possibly resulting in some missed variant calls for more evolutionarily divergent individuals.\n",
